cr-oc-spanish extension for Opencart 2

-------------------------------
INTRODUCTION:
-------------------------------

Provides Spanish translations for the main backend and frontend interfaces (admin and catalog)

The spanish texts included here were taken from other packages for other versions of Opencart, and since Opencart 2 includes a lot of new texts, there are still a large number of texts that haven't been translated yet.


-------------------------------
IMPORTANT NOTES:
-------------------------------

I haven't finished all the translations, and I know there are errors, so PLEASE HELP ME OUT:

ALSO, I've only actually tested this on Opencart 2.0.3.1, but I assume it's compatible with more versions. If you use a different version, please let me know if it works!

If you run into issues, let me know on github, thanks!
